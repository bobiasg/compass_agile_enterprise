## Relationship between Parties and Fixed Assets to see who may been assigned or checked out
## an asset.
## IMPORTANT NOTE: The base framework does not extend Party or Fixed Asset to automatically show these
## relationships. It is considered purpose-specific enough so that Party and Fixed asset can be given
## the relationship code on a case-by-case basis.
